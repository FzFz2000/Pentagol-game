# Pentagol-game
 This game is very similar to the famous game Pentago with slight differences:
 The goal is not to creat a line of 5 marbles, but to creat the L shape:a line of 4 marbles and another one next to its end.
 Three L types are accepted:
 1) horizental
 2) vertical
 3) diagonal
 this game is programmed for two players.
 In part one we determine the position we want to place the marble in by entering the number.
 then we tell the program to spin desired plate in the clock wise or anti click wise way
by entering the number of plate and the rotation.
 The second part uses graphics to make the apperance more appealing
 Players place the marble and turn a plate in a specefic direction using mouse.
